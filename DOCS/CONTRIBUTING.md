3. Keep lines of code within a reasonable length (e.g., 80 characters).
4. Use meaningful and descriptive variable and function names.
5. Comment your code to explain complex logic or any non-obvious behavior.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a clean and readable codebase that is easier to understand and maintain.
